# Homepage notes

This is a dummy component to describe how the redux store works (and connecting it to the app).

## Steps:
1. We define our prop types for the component at the top:
2. 
   ```typescript
   interface HomePageProps {
    id?: string; // the ? means that the prop isn't mandatory
    color?: string;
    }
   ```
